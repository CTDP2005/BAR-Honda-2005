[INFO]
SCREEN_NAME=B.A.R HONDA #3						; Name of the car. Used on info apps ingame and to identify the car on servers etc.

[BASIC]
GRAPHICS_OFFSET=0,-0.1,0.55				; 3 axis correction (x,y,z), applies only to the 3D object of the car (meters)
GRAPHICS_PITCH_ROTATION=0.3				; Changes 3D object rotation in pitch (degrees)
TOTALMASS=605								; Total vehicle weight in kg with driver and no fuel
INERTIA=1.9,0.8,3.4							; Car polar inertia. Calculated from the car dimensions. Start with the generic width,height,length and modify accordingly to the car's configuration 

[GRAPHICS]
DRIVEREYES=0,0.66001,-0.11589				; 3 axis placement (x,y,z) of driver eyes (POV). in meters
ONBOARD_EXPOSURE=33							; Onboard camera exposure for HDR
OUTBOARD_EXPOSURE=31						; Outboard camera exposure for HDR
ON_BOARD_PITCH_ANGLE=-0.0458742				; Onboard driver eyes pitch angle relative to the horizon
BUMPER_CAMERA_POS=0.0,0.10,2.45			; Bumper camera position (meters)
BONNET_CAMERA_POS=0.0,0.60,0.84				; Bonnet camera position (meters)
MIRROR_POSITION=0.0,1.3,0.5 				; Position used to render the mirror
SHAKE_MUL=1.5								; Camera onboard G forces multiplier 
USE_ANIMATED_SUSPENSIONS=0					; Use animated suspensions (1) or not (0). Animated suspensions will not be updated in real time from setup changes.

STEER_LOCK=200								; Real car's steer lock from center to right
STEER_RATIO=9.5							; Steer ratio
LINEAR_STEER_ROD_RATIO=0.00178				; Because of AC complex suspension geometry, you need to calculate manually the steer rod ratio
; Enter AC in dev app mode enabled
; Open SUSPENSIONS app
; turn your steering wheel by 90 degrees
; check the actual steer ratio value
; modify LINEAR_STEER_ROD_RATIO value until ingame steer ratio and car.ini STEER_RATIO values are similar
